Notes on providing a demo of the mtz-login component

- Start the app by following the instructions in README.txt.

- Files
  * index.html uses demo-login-page
  * demo-login-page uses mtz-login and
    includes the "Logout" button and
    a dropdown menu for selecting a language
    - the function that is called when the Logout button
      is pressed is provided by mtz-logout-behavior
    - this allows apps to support other logout UIs
      such as a hyperlink instead of a button
  * mtz-login uses paper elements and iron-ajax;
    only includes inputs for username and password
    and the "Login" button

- There are three known users.
  * dweir/dw1
  * amurdock/am1
  * mvolkmann/mv1

- enter an invalid username and/or password
  and press the Login button
  * message "invalid username or password" is displayed

- enter mvolkmann/mv1 and press the "Login" button
  * note that the account for this user is locked

- enter dweir/dw1 and press the "Login" button
  * this will succeed and direct the user to the home page
    which is currently configured to be the main Polymer page
  * press the browser back button to return to the login page
  * show the contents of sessionStorage using Chrome Developer Tools
    - will contain "preferredLanguage",
      "token" (the authentication token returned by the login process),
      and "username"
  * press the "Logout" button
  * note that sessionStorage has been cleared

- press the "forgot" link
  * will see a dialog prompting for username and email address
  * this is a work in progress
  * it will email a password reset link to the user
    if the email address they provide
    matches the one on file for that username

- select different languages from the language dropdown
  * show that all the text except the heading "Demo Login Page"
    is translated
  * this is performed by mtz-trans-lang-behavior which provides
    setLanguage and translate methods that any element
    which includes the behavior can call
  * language translations are stored in JSON files
    in the translations directory
    - show es.json or fr.json for examples
